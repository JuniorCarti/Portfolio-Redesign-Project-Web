code .
```

### 4. Run Live Server

# 💻 How Sections Are Organized in `index.html`

Each main section is clearly commented like this:

```html
<!-- ===== HERO SECTION ===== -->
<section id="hero" class="hero">
    <!-- Your work here -->
</section>
```

✅ Only modify the section assigned to you.  
✅ Do not touch other people's code to avoid conflicts.

---

# 🔀 Branching Strategy

- Each contributor must **create a branch** from `main`:
  ```
  git checkout -b section-hero-redesign
  ```
- Name your branch clearly based on your section.
- After completing your work, **push your branch** and create a **Pull Request**.
- Merge only after review.
