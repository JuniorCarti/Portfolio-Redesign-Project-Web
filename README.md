# Portfolio Redesign Project 🚀

Welcome to the **Portfolio Redesign Project** — a collaborative effort to redesign and enhance key sections of the portfolio site for better performance, design, and user experience.

---

## 📋 Project Overview

This project focuses on improving and redesigning the main sections of the portfolio website. Each team member is responsible for a specific section, working on a separate branch to ensure clean and organized development.

After all individual improvements are completed, we will merge everything into the `main` branch to create a unified, upgraded portfolio.

## 🔥 Workflow Guidelines

- Each contributor works on their **assigned section** on a **separate branch**.
- Follow the branch naming convention:  
  `feature/<section-name>-update`
  
  Example: `feature/hero-section-redesign`
- Only modify your section’s files unless otherwise needed.
- When modifying `index.html`, only insert your section’s HTML **inside the correct placeholder**.
- Make sure to pull the latest changes from `main` before creating a pull request.
- Keep commits clean and descriptive (e.g., "Added redesigned Hero Section layout").
- After completing your section, create a Pull Request (PR) and request a review.
